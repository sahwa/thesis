\section{30x 1000 genomes dataset}

Samples from \cite{byrska2021high}.

This dataset consists of 3,202 modern individuals from 26 worldwide populations, sequenced to a targeted depth of 30x coverage. The downloaded dataset was aligned to the gr38 reference genome.

Samples were downloaded to the UCL Computer Science cluster by myself from the ftp mirror.

The following steps were taken to process the data before being used as an imputation reference. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Filtered such that SNPs with only 2 alleles were retained
\item Performed a liftover to hg19 using LiftoverVcf from picard tools \cite{Picard2018toolkit}
\item Filter again for SNPs with only 2 alleles
\item Phase using shapeit4, using the `sequencing' parameter and setting --pbwt-depth 4.
\item Remove duplicated SNPs using bcftools norm \cite{li2009sequence} 
\item Use Beagle's conform-gt utility to ensure reference alleles were consistent with the previous 1000 genomes build. This was done because all previous datasets I have compiled were also conformed to the previous 1000 genomes build. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Human Origins dataset}

Samples from various studies. 

This dataset consists of 560,420 SNPS and 5998 individuals from 509 worldwide populations.
